# Squash-em-Up
First ever Couch Co-op Try

A simple Two player movement script with animation and sounds 
With simple logic of player jumping on the platform that matches its own colour
Also having a simple switch for player that can be triggered while standing on it(So blue cube triggers pink switch). That enables and disables some platforms in level
Some changing platforms that keep changing based on time
Lasers to add difficulty in the game
